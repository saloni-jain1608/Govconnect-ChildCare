    <textOnly>Your application for In-Home Aide certification has been approved by your County Agency. Your certificate is attached.

Prior to providing publicly funded child care services, you must enter into an agreement with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) by completing the JFS 01144 ‘Provider Agreement for Publicly Funded Child Care Services,’ including the provider agreement, banking information and rate information. These three forms must be electronically submitted using the CCIDS Provider Portal prior to providing publicly funded child care services.

Additional information about this process is available at www.jfs.ohio.gov/cdc/CCIDS.stm

Please contact your County Agency with additional questions about your certification.
