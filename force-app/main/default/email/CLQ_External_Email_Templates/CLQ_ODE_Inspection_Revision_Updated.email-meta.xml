    <textOnly>The purpose of this email is to notify you that the results of the inspection for {!CLQ_Inspection__c.CLQ_Program_Name__c} {!CLQ_Role__c.CLQ_Program_name_Formula__c}, {!CLQ_Inspection__c.Program_Number__c}{!CLQ_Role__c.CLQ_Program_Number_Formula__c} completed on {!CLQ_Inspection__c.CLQ_Inspection_End_Date__c} {!CLQ_Role__c.CLQ_Inspection_End_Date__c} has been revised.

A copy of the revised report is attached. Please discard the previous version. The licensing inspection report will identify if a corrective action response is required. The program must submit the corrective action plan through OCLQS for each noncompliance that requires a response.

If you have any questions regarding the inspection report revisions, contact your department representative or the Child Care Help Desk at 1-877-302-2347.
