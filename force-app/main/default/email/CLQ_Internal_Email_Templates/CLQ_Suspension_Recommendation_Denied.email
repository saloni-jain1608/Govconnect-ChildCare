The recommendation for the immediate suspension of the child care license for {!CLQ_Case_Custom__c.CLQ_Program_Number_Formula__c}, {!CLQ_Case_Custom__c.CLQ_Program_Name_Formula__c} has been denied.  The {!$Label.JobFamilyDept} looks at each recommendation on a case by case basis and determines if the information supports an immediate suspension.  After review of the recommendation, including all factors specific to this recommendation, it has been determined that the recommendation did not meet one of the qualifying reasons listed in {!$Label.StateName} Revised Code.  

Thank You.  

The {!$Label.StateName} Child Licensing and Quality System Team.
